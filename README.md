Repository
==========

It's a repository, storing my idea, coming from my initiative, some are idea made
at home, some are widget designed at job during free and spare time... There is 
much more here about my idea than my work left in many compagny since 1999. 

Preface
=======
	
Aim to had futuristic view of a Lab, some may beleive adding Biohazard-level being
hook to concept of building Lab's secure place and some may attached Merchandising
to provoke an incubating effect to promote concept while sometimes is just bought 
from a neighbourhood et re-wrapped like an old-clumsy parsnip . But Here it's 
paper-lab, way before building with brick and adding rooms to grow about anything
it's idea to be developped.... Sometimes I may wish to get an idea to end into 
a contraptor-machine receiving the list and building the final Real-object without
never had to imagine a piece of code fall into a conception mode and end in a box
after pushing last element... Not like ACME tools but sort of ... 


About
=====

It's probably more my idea of "a LAB" than previously see somewhere... Some may 
also introduce in Lab, some 'commandite-like' topics, some called it 
fortune-announcement... It's way out of a Lab we do this, but in Press-Room or 
a 'commandite-salon' we should call it...  By the way there is no test-tube here,
only concept called test-tube, module calles test-tube, methodology called 
test-tube, modeling called test-tube... But no test-tube... Only virtuall. 


Specific Purposes
=================

It's a place also were code, idea, and schema, design, scan and wild example are
landing here... Sometimes is usefull to not worry about formating your system and
leaving the design away to clone it back into your not installed system... Also 
since I own an Acer-one, tinyer than my actual develpt-location, it's a day dream
to update source from a side to another one... Especially for working with 
Vmware station, virtual station and some distant machine having exceptionnal 
hardware or simply a self-shelve in a Library after having a read on something 
interesting... 

It's also pratice to develop Document, paper-draft and mind-note for futur design. 
A something to prepare for the future when it's time to present realistic thing.
Github allow creating a branch and even Readme.rst can be branched into-something
more Straight-foward when it's time to present thing like my Fnct.D bash lib, 
willing to have guts to present a Page-cover to a Administration shell-management.
