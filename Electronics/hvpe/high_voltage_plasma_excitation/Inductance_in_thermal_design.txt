plate 1 darlinton Double pair Darlington with Inductance protection on each transistor.
- goal, conversion from Henry to Joule for decay Of lawrencium 

- Having uses AWG 24 with .019 in +/- (.002 in in diameter ) for wiring the thermal dissipation
to clear and cool down the transistor, there is implicite magnetance ability for each transistor
to not di-electrically be impared by presence of nuclear reation. Aka gamma ray and alpha-ray 
may compromise the Beta-hFE in any moment by directly increase amount of electron in circulation. 

- Having dopped each resistor R1 and R2 and transistor from 2 Darlingtons pairs of Lawrencium 
epoxy-compound the gamma-ray and possible alpha-ray is totally present. Affecting Beta-Hfe during 
cut-off or signal emission from each transistor, this wire around transistor can collect excess 
of upcoming energy . 

Notice : Lawrencium extracted from mine is doped with many other elements like uranium, and 
other pro-actinide . Weight mass ratio is around 266 gr / mol , and wikipedia did not talk 
about mine discovery hold untreatable and to fissible uranium found in north-east of 
Ontario around lower Baie-Hudson mine hold too heavy Uranium and plaussible Lawrencium. 

typical transistor region can be mesured from emiter side to collector side and 

emitter side to collector length = .183 in -> ideal diameter from side to side length 0.221 in  
front to rear length  .138 in  -> ideal diameter from rear to front lenght 0.178 in. 
- will give an approximate circular diameter of 0.1995 in 

Each transistor height is around .182 in and by wiring almost it's height will give for 0.020 in of AWG 24 9.1 turn... 

so ideally inductance L is about 0.30318 uH
